# 🔥 Spark Neural Insight

An interactive web application that visually demonstrates how text prompts are processed inside a neural network and how AI output is generated in real time. This project breaks down the AI inference process — from tokenization to layer animations to live probability distributions — into an intuitive visual experience.

## 🎯 Overview

Spark Neural Insight makes AI inference transparent and educational by visualizing how neural networks process text prompts. Watch tokens flow through network layers, see probabilities update in real-time, and understand the magic behind AI text generation through interactive animations.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Prompt Tokenization & Visualization** — Converts input text into visual tokens
- 🧠 **Layer Animation** — Simulates token propagation through neural network layers
- ⚡ **Real-Time Output Streaming** — Displays AI-generated text token by token
- 📊 **Live Probability Display** — Updates token probabilities dynamically
- 🖱️ **Interactive UI** — Responsive interface with smooth animations
- 📚 **Simplified Neural Metaphor** — Makes complex AI concepts approachable

## 🧠 How It Works

**1. Tokenization**  
Input text is split into simple word tokens for visualization.

**2. Layer Progression Animation**  
Tokens move through animated neural network layers to depict forward processing.

**3. Streaming Output**  
Model responses are streamed in real time, updating UI incrementally.

**4. Probability Visualization**  
Probabilities are estimated from streamed text and shown live (for educational purposes).
