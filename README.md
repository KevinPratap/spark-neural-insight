# 🔥 spark-neural-insight

An interactive web application that visually demonstrates how text prompts are processed inside a neural network and how AI output is generated in real time. This project breaks down the AI inference process — from tokenization to layer animations to live probability distributions — into an intuitive visual experience.

## ✨ Key Features

✅ Prompt Tokenization & Visualization — Converts input text into visual tokens  
✅ Layer Animation — Simulates token propagation through neural network layers  
✅ Real-Time Output Streaming — Displays AI-generated text token by token  
✅ Live Probability Display — Updates token probabilities dynamically  
✅ Interactive UI — Responsive interface with animations  
✅ Simplified Neural Metaphor — Makes complex AI concepts approachable

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Tokenization**  
   Input text is split into simple word tokens for visualization.

2. **Layer Progression Animation**  
   Tokens move through animated neural network layers to depict forward processing.

3. **Streaming Output**  
   Model responses are streamed in real time, updating UI incrementally.

4. **Probability Visualization**  
   Probabilities are estimated from streamed text and shown live (for educational purposes).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React + TypeScript** — Core app  
- **Framer Motion** — UI animation  
- **Custom AI Stream Hook** — Handles streamed model responses  
- **TailwindCSS** (assumed) — Styling  
- **Lucide Icons** — Visual clarity  
- **Modular Components** — Clean structure
